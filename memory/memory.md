# IRES CRM — Project Memory

_Read this first. It's the "what & why" so you don't have to reverse-engineer the codebase._

## What this is
A CRM for **Instant Real Estate Solution (IRES)** — a Delaware / New Castle County (NCC) real-estate
**wholesaling, flipping, and buy-and-rent** business. The CRM's headline feature is one-click automations:
a team member clicks **"Scrape Sheriff Sales This Week"** (or Legal Notices) and the system scrapes the
county data, enriches it, and shows it live in the CRM — with a **deal pipeline** to track which
properties we've reviewed, contacted, made offers on, etc.

## Why it exists (origin)
It started as a **Python + n8n + Railway** pipeline that scraped NCC sheriff-sale and legal-notice PDFs,
enriched them with Zillow + parcel data, and dumped rows into Google Sheets + email. That was fragile
(n8n/Railway flakiness, not team-friendly, needed Docker/self-hosting). **Goal: replace all of that with
one CRM the non-technical team controls** — owned by us, free, serverless, everything in one place.

## The stack (the user's standard — don't deviate)
- **Convex** — backend, reactive DB, serverless functions, cron. (No server, no Docker, scales to zero.)
- **Clerk** — auth.
- **TanStack Router + React + Tailwind** — frontend.
- **Cloudflare** — hosting (frontend). Same pattern as the user's other CRMs (BlueRock, Peak Web, Yachts Direct).
- **Firecrawl** — the only scraper (cloud API: PDF scrape, NCC parcel browser-actions, Zillow). It runs the
  headless browser in its cloud, so we never run a browser ourselves.
- **OpenRouter** — LLM extraction, used ONLY for Legal Notices (prose → structured listings).

> A serverless CRM was briefly almost built on self-hosted **Twenty** (open-source CRM) for its UI, but
> dropped — Twenty needs a 24/7 Docker server, the opposite of serverless. Its source is archived in
> `docs/twenty-app-archived/` for UI reference only. **Do not re-propose Twenty/Docker.**

## Two automation pipelines
1. **Sheriff Sales** — monthly NCC "Current Sheriff Sale Listing" PDF → parse table → clean addresses →
   enrich each with NCC **parcel** data (owner, assessment, county/school/sewer balances) + **Zillow**
   (zestimate, beds/baths/sqft).
2. **Legal Notices** — weekly NCC estate/probate PDF → **LLM-extract** estate listings (deceased "late of"
   address + personal rep) → **Zillow** enrich.

## How it's wired (the pattern)
Button → **Clerk-authed Convex mutation** (`startScrape`, records intent, refuses concurrent runs) →
schedules an **internalAction** → the action scrapes + parses + inserts rows (status `pending`) → **fans
out** one `enrich` action per row via `ctx.scheduler` → each enriches and patches its row → the reactive
UI fills in live. Idempotent: skips an already-scraped month/week unless forced.

## Data model (Convex `convex/schema.ts`)
- `scrapeRuns` — one per execution (type, label, status, counts) → run history / progress.
- `sheriffListings` — scraped + parcel + Zillow fields + `dealStatus` + `notes`.
- `legalNotices` — scraped + Zillow fields + `dealStatus` + `notes`.
- Shared pipeline: `dealStatus` = new → reviewing → contacted → offer → dead.

## Code map
- `src/scraper/*` — **runtime-agnostic scraping core** (Firecrawl client, sheriff parse, address clean,
  parcel, zillow, legalNotices, enrich). Proven against live Firecrawl. Reused by the Convex actions.
- `convex/*` — `schema`, `sheriffData`/`sheriffActions`, `legalData`/`legalActions`, `runs`, `crons`,
  `auth.config`, `helpers`. (`*Actions` are `"use node"`; `*Data` are V8 queries/mutations.)
- `src/web/*` — React app: `main` (Convex provider), `app` (router + IRES shell), `pages` (Dashboard,
  Sheriff Sales, Legal Notices).

## Status (2026-06-01)
Both pipelines proven **live end-to-end on the real Convex dev deployment** `fearless-donkey-585`
(project `instantrealestate`). Frontend builds + serves against it. Clerk + Cloudflare + prod deploy are
the remaining user-side steps. See `next-session-prompt.md`.
